# About Me

Hi I'm Michael and currently I work at Fastly on the Compute@Edge platform where
I help build the compute platform by making it performant and also add new
features. In fact if you're reading this right now it was served from that
platform and if you're curious about how I did it you can read about it
[here](/the-edge).

While I have spent a lot of time in the industry focused on tech things outside
of work, these days I'm pretty content just doing my job and spending time
outside of work doing things I find meaningful. Hiking or quality time with my
partner are primary examples of this. Tech is interesting, I like what I do, but
I want to do more than just that.

If you need to get in touch with me you can head to my [contact
page](/contact) for more information.
