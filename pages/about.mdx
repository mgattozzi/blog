# About Me

Hi I'm Michael!

While I have spent a lot of time in the industry focused on tech things outside
of work, these days I'm pretty content just doing my job and spending time
outside of work doing things I find meaningful. Hiking or quality time with my
partner are primary examples of this. Tech is interesting, I like what I do, but
I want to do more than just that.

If you need to get in touch with me you can head to my [contact
page](/contact) for more information.
